# mui-react-importmap

The goal of this project is to showcase how we can externalize dependencies while:
- keeping type checking
- utilizing CDNs to fetch our dependencies
- utilizing the importmap standard to wire in dependency URLs

This way we can speed up the build process dramatically without any transpiling hacks.
